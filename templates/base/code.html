    This is a project that I'm starting to make it easier for me to sync iTunes on my 
    Mac with my Android phone. Sure, other projects exist for this, but they're either 
    expensive or they don't work very well (or both). I want to make a free, open source 
    version that is simple to use, syncs your playlists and tracks both ways and I can use it myself!
  </p>
  <p>
    I may, at some point, create a GUI version and put it on the Android store for cheap, 
    but the script that resides here will always be free and open source.'

    checkreg is a mobile app that lets you put in expenses.  That's all.  I developed
    it because my wife and I are have been known to spend a little too much money and
    we wanted a way to track what we have spent.  You would usually use a check registry
    for this, but what happens when she's out shopping and spending money and I'm at home
    and have a sudden hankering for a new programming book on Amazon.com or a new track
    on Beatport?!  I need to see if she's spent too much money in real-time!  checkreg
    to the rescue.  Although you do have to update it every time you make a purchase by
    putting your purchase in, this allows us to track how much money is in our checking
    account at any given time and watch what we have spent.  I plan on playing around
    with this application more in the near future.

    I'm basically using django for the backend and jQuery mobile for the front end. I
    recently switch to jQuery mobile after using jQtouch in and effort to make the
    project a little more modularized.  I have noticed it's a bit slower right now
    and a little more quirky, but I plan on finding ways to fix that up.

  <p>
    Yes, it's a generic name.  Yes, I have thought about changing it.  Why did I name it this?
    Because.  At the time, I was sick of obscure names for command line arguments. In hindsight,
    it makes sense to name it something simple, yet unique.
  </p>
  <p>
    What is it? It's a command line SMTP client that support TLS, SMTP AUTH, Attachments,
    encryption with GPG and some other basic features.  It was created originally to be
    a very simple SMTP client for mailing reports by a nightly crontab. It has grown a bit,
    but has stayed pretty simple.  It's written in C and depends on my own C library called
    dlib. I don't code on this project as much as I used to, but I still do keep it up to
    date by fixing bugs and doing the occasional feature enhancement.

  {% last_commit commits.dlib %}
  </header>
  <p>
    dlib is simply a library I use for my C projects. It has stuff like string buffers,
    linked lists, vectors, hash tables and some basic network type functions. It's
    all utility type stuff.  I originally wrote it to accompany eMail.  However, I
    have used it in some other projects that I have not published and died quickly. There
    isn't too much activity on this project.
